  Each form field should have its own explicit label. The label tag sorts this out, with a 
  for attribute that associates it to a form element:

  > &nbsp;
  >> Labels have the added bonus of visual browsers rendering the labels themselves clickable, putting the focus on the associated form field.

  	Both name and id attributs are typically required; the name for the form to handle that field and the id for the label to associate it to.
