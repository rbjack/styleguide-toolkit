 */

// The HTML Address Element should be used by authors to supply contact 
// information for its nearest <article> or <body> ancestor; in the latter case, it 
// applies to the whole document.
address {
	
}

// The HTML Article Element represents a self-contained composition in a 
// document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently 
// distributable or reusable, e.g., in syndication. This could be a forum post, a magazine 
// or newspaper article, a blog entry, or any other independent item of content. Each 
// <article> should be identified, typically by including a heading (h1-h6 element) as a 
// child of the <article> element.
article {
	
}
// The HTML Body Element represents the content of an HTML document. There can be only 
// one <body> element in a document.
body {
	
}

// The HTML Footer Element  represents a footer for its nearest sectioning content or 
// sectioning root element. A footer typically contains information about the author of the 
// section, copyright data or links to related documents.
footer {
	
}

// The HTML Header Element represents a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may 
// contain some heading elements but also other elements like a logo, wrapped section's header, 
// a search form, and so on.
header {
	
}

// Heading elements implement six levels of document headings, <h1> is the most important and 
// <h6> is the least. A heading element briefly describes the topic of the section it introduces. 
// Heading information may be used by user agents, for example, to construct a table of contents 
// for a document automatically.
h1 {
	
}

h2 {
	
	@media print {
		page-break-after: avoid;
		orphans: 3;
		widows: 3;
	}
}

h3 {
	
	@media print {
		page-break-after: avoid;
		orphans: 3;
		widows: 3;
	}
}

h4 {
	
}

h5 {
	
}

h6 {
	
}

// The HTML Headings Group Element represents the heading of a section. It defines a single title 
// that participates in the outline of the document as the heading of the implicit or explicit 
// section that it belongs to.
hgroup {
	
}

// The HTML Navigation Element represents a section of a page that links to other pages or to parts 
// within the page: a section with navigation links.
nav {
	
}

// The HTML Section Element (<section>) represents a generic section of a document, i.e., a thematic 
// grouping of content, typically with a heading. Each <section> should be identified, typically by 
// including a heading (<h1>-<h6> element) as a child of the <section> element.
