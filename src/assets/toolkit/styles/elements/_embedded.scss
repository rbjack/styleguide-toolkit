/**
 * Embedded Elements
 */

// The HTML Embed Element represents an integration point for an external application or 
// interactive content (in other words, a plug-in).
embed {}

// The HTML Inline Frame Element represents a nested browsing context, effectively 
// embedding another HTML page into the current page. In HTML 4.01, a document may contain 
// a head and a body or a head and a frame-set, but not both a body and a frame-set. 
// However, an <iframe> can be used within a normal document body. Each browsing context has 
// its own session history and active document. The browsing context that contains the embedded 
// content is called the parent browsing context. The top-level browsing context (which has no 
// parent) is typically the browser window.
iframe {}

// The HTML Embedded Object Element (<object>) represents an external resource, which can be 
// treated as an image, a nested browsing context, or a resource to be handled by a plugin.
object {}

// The HTML Parameter Element defines parameters for <object>.
param {}

// The HTML Source element is used to specify multiple media resources for <picture>, <audio> 
// and <video> elements. It is an empty element. It is commonly used to serve the same media in 
// multiple formats supported by different browsers.
source {}
