// embedded

/*
<embed>	The HTML <embed> Element represents an integration point for an external application or interactive content (in other words, a plug-in).
<iframe>	The HTML Inline Frame Element (<iframe>) represents a nested browsing context, effectively embedding another HTML page into the current page. In HTML 4.01, a document may contain a head and a body or a head and a frame-set, but not both a body and a frame-set. However, an <iframe> can be used within a normal document body. Each browsing context has its own session history and active document. The browsing context that contains the embedded content is called the parent browsing context. The top-level browsing context (which has no parent) is typically the browser window.
<object>	The HTML Embedded Object Element (<object>) represents an external resource, which can be treated as an image, a nested browsing context, or a resource to be handled by a plugin.
<param>	The HTML <param> Element (or HTML Parameter Element) defines parameters for <object>.
<source>	The HTML <source> element is used to specify multiple media resources for <picture>, <audio> and <video> elements. It is an empty element. It is commonly used to serve the same media in multiple formats supported by different browsers.
